            <h2>Agile Methodology</h2>
            <p>Agile project management is an iterative approach to planning and guiding project processes. It emphasizes flexibility, continuous improvement, and rapid delivery.</p>

            <h3>Agile Principles and Values</h3>
            <p>The Agile Manifesto outlines four core values:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
                <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
                <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
                <li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Agile Methodologies</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Scrum</h4>
                    <p>A framework that uses fixed-length iterations of work, called sprints.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Product Owner:</strong> Responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scrum Master:</strong> Ensures that the Scrum process is used as intended and helps remove impediments to the team's progress.</li>
                        <li><strong>Development Team:</strong> Consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Kanban</h4>
                    <p>A method for managing the creation of products with an emphasis on continual delivery while not overburdening the development team.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Visualize the Workflow:</strong> Use a board to represent the flow of work and track progress.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limit Work in Progress (WIP):</strong> Limit the amount of work in progress at any given time to avoid overburdening the team.</li>
                        <li><strong>Manage Flow:</strong> Continuously monitor and improve the flow of work.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Extreme Programming (XP)</h4>
                    <p>Emphasizes technical excellence and customer satisfaction through frequent "releases" in short development cycles.
					</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pair Programming:</strong> Two programmers work together at one workstation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Test-Driven Development (TDD):</strong> Write tests before writing the actual code.</li>
                        <li><strong>Continuous Integration:</strong> Integrate and test code changes frequently.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)</h4>
                    <p>An Agile project delivery framework that delivers the right solution at the right time.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>MoSCoW Prioritization:</strong> Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have this time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Timeboxing:</strong> Fixed periods for completing tasks or features.</li>
                        <li><strong>Iterative Development:</strong> Incremental approach to building the solution.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Crystal</h4>
                    <p>A family of Agile methodologies that focus on people and the interaction among them while they work on a software project.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Frequent Delivery:</strong> Deliver working software frequently.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reflective Improvement:</strong> Regularly reflect on how to become more effective.</li>
                        <li><strong>Osmotic Communication:</strong> Information flows osmotically through team co-location.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Traditional vs. Agile Project Management</h3>
            <table>
                <tr>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Requirements</td>
                    <td>Fixed at the beginning</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Customer Involvement</td>
                    <td>Mainly at the beginning and end</td>

                <tr>
                    <td>Delivery</td>
                    <td>Single delivery at the end</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Change</td>
                    <td>Resistant to change</td>
                    <td>Embraces change</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <h3>Hybrid Approaches</h3>
            <p>Hybrid approaches combine elements of both traditional and Agile methodologies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Water-Scrum-Fall:</strong> Uses Scrum for development within a traditional waterfall framework.</li>
                <li><strong>Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD):</strong> A process decision framework that combines strategies from various Agile methods.</li>
                <li><strong>Scrumban:</strong> Combines Scrum and Kanban, using Scrum as the planning method and Kanban to manage WIP.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice Question</h3>
            <p>In Scrum, who is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team?</p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Scrum Master</li>
                <li>Product Owner</li>
                <li>Development Team</li>
                <li>Project Manager</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> b. Product Owner</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In Scrum, the Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team. They manage the product backlog and ensure that the team is working on the most valuable features.</p>
